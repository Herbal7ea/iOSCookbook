# iOSCookbook
Snippets of code for all things iOS

Because I move between iOS and Android, I got tired of not remembering the syntax of rarely used code, and started building out this Cookbook of snippet code.  It's formatted in a way that is easy for me to use, but you are welcome to use it too.  I used to use the O'Rielly iOS Cookbook books, but as of iOS 12 they aren't made any more, and their UI components code is... from iOS 7 and in Objective-C.  This is to replace what that was for me.
